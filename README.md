# CGRA-352-A2-Core
For assignment 2, the core part of the assignment was to implement a patchmatch algorithm. The patchmatch algorithm takes 2 arguments, a source and a target image. The purpose of this implementation is to recreate the target image by using pixels in the source image. In order to do this, I created a Nearest-Neighbour Field (NNF) to store the mappings
